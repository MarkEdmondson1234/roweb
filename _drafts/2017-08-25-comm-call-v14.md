Our [Community Call on Wednesday, September 13th, 8-9 AM PST](https://github.com/ropensci/commcalls/issues/14), will cover "How to ask questions so they get answered! Possibly by yourself!". Asking questions about programming is a skill you can develop - we're not just born with it. The speakers will cover some of the background and skills you'll need to increase your chances of having your questions answered by your peers or by a busy expert.

Speaker bios
-----------------------------------------------------------------
**Noam Ross** works in reinsurance in New York City. He builds risk models which, according to [George Box](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1976.10480949), are wrong. In spite of this inconvenient truth, James has proved successful at convincing his employer that his models are useful. James writes poorly commented, inefficient code using Python, R, SQL, and expletives.

James grew up in Kentucky and has multiple degrees from the University of Kentucky. After being marooned on the archipelago of Bermuda for four years, James now lives in Jersey City, NJ with his Minecraft addicted 9 year old daughter and his wife, a recovering trial lawyer.

**Andee Kaplan** is a Postdoctoral Fellow at Duke University. She is a recent PhD graduate from the Iowa State University Department of Statistics, where she learned a lot about R and reproducibility by developing a class on data stewardship for Agronomists. Andee has reviewed multiple (two) packages for rOpenSci and hopes to one day be on the receiving end of the review process.
